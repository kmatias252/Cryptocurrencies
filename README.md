# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Cryptocurrencies Analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate our ability to show what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. In this challenge, I created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Lastly, I will use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.

## Deliverables: 

* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Results:

## Summary: 

Based on our analysis and use of unsupervised learning we are able to provide our client with visualizations to share with the board of directors. One of which is the elbow curve which uses K-means algorithm to cluster the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data and make predictions based on the cryptocurrency data. The next is a 3D scatter plot which plots the three clusters of cryptocurrencies (PC 1, PC 2 and PC 3). Lastly, we created a 2D scatter plot which displays the Total Coins Mined, the Total Coin Supply, the Coin Name and the Class to inform the board of directors who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.
